 *题目描述：
	    This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two matrices, and then count the number of zero rows and columns.
	输入：
	    The input consists of several test cases, each starts with a pair of positive integers M and N (≤10) which are the number of rows and columns of the matrices, respectively. Then 2*M lines follow, each contains N integers in [-100, 100], separated by a space. The first M lines correspond to the elements of A and the second M lines to that of B.
	    The input is terminated by a zero M and that case must NOT be processed.
	输出：
	    For each test case you should output in one line the total number of zero rows and columns of A+B.
